      <b>About:</b> Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a
      South Asian country marked by lush greenery and many waterways. Its Padma,
      Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is
      common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest
      shared with Eastern India, is home to the <b> royal Bengal tiger</b> .
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Climate:</b> Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is
      tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer
      from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature
      below <b>0 °C (32 °F)</b>, with a record low of <b>1.1 °C (34.0 °F)</b> in
      the northwest city of Dinajpur on <b>3 February 1905</b>.
      <sup>[249] </sup> A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to
      October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities,
      such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost
      every year, <sup>[250]</sup> combined with the effects of deforestation,
      soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of <b>1970</b> and
      <b>1991</b> were particularly devastating, the latter killing
      approximately <b>140,000</b> people. <sup>[251]</sup>

      <b> About Dhaka:</b> Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern
      Asia. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national
      government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal
      capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect
      Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge,
      fast-growing modern metropolis
    </p>

      <b>About Cox's Bazar:</b>Cox’s Bazar is a town on the southeast coast of
      Bangladesh. It’s known for its very long, sandy beachfront, stretching
      from Sea Beach in the north to Kolatoli Beach in the south. Aggameda
      Khyang monastery is home to bronze statues and centuries-old Buddhist
      manuscripts. South of town, the tropical rainforest of Himchari National
      Park has waterfalls and many birds. North, sea turtles breed on nearby
      Sonadia Island

      <b>About Chattogram:</b>Chittagong is large port city on the southeastern
      coast of Bangladesh. The Ethnological Museum has exhibits about the many
      different ethnic tribes across the country. Zia Memorial Museum, inside
      the former Old Circuit House, displays items belonging to former president
      Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated on the site in 1981. The landmark
      Chandanpura Mosque has many onion-shaped domes and brightly painted
      minarets
